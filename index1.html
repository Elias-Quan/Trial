stator currents, in exactly the same way that the Xux density interacts with the
rotor currents to produce torque on the rotor. In other motors, (e.g. the d.c.
motor we have been looking at), there is no simple physical argument which can
be advanced to derive the torque on the stator, but nevertheless it is equal and
opposite to the torque on the rotor. The Wnal question relates to the similarity
between the set-up shown in Figure 1.10 and the Weld patterns produced for
example by the electromagnets used to lift car bodies in a scrap yard. From
what we know of the large force of attraction that lifting magnets can produce,
might not we expect a large radial force between the stator pole and the iron
body of the rotor? And if there is, what is to prevent the rotor from being
pulled across to the stator? Again the aYrmative answer is that there is indeed
a radial force due to magnetic attraction, exactly as in a lifting magnet or
relay, although the mechanism whereby the magnetic Weld exerts a pull as it
enters iron or steel is entirely diVerent from the ‘BIl’ force we have been
looking at so far. It turns out that the force of attraction per unit area of
pole-face is proportional to the square of the radial Xux density, and with
typical airgap Xux densities of up to 1 T in motors, the force per unit area of
rotor surface works out to be about 40 N=cm 2 . This indicates that the total
radial force can be very large: for example the force of attraction on a small
pole-face of only 5  10 cm is 2000 N, or about 200 Kg. This force contributes
nothing to the torque of the motor, and is merely an unwelcome by-product of
the ‘BIl’ mechanism we employ to produce tangential force on the rotor
conductors. In most machines the radial magnetic force under each pole is
actually a good deal bigger than the tangential electromagnetic force on the
rotor conductors, and as the question implies, it tends to pull the rotor onto
the pole. However, the majority of motors are constructed with an even number of
poles equally spaced around the rotor, and the Xux density in each pole is the
same, so that  in theory at least  the resultant force on the complete rotor
is zero. In practice, even a small eccentricity will cause the Weld to be
stronger under the poles where the air-gap is smaller, and this will give rise
to an unbalanced pull, resulting in noisy running and rapid bearing wear.
Magnitude of torque Returning to our original discussion, the force on each
conductor is given by equation 1.2, and it follows that the total tangential
force F depends on the Xux density produced by the Weld winding, the number of
conductors</p> <p>by the interaction of the air-gap Xux density and the stator
currents, in exactly the same way that the Xux density interacts with the rotor
currents to produce torque on the rotor. In other motors, (e.g. the d.c. motor
